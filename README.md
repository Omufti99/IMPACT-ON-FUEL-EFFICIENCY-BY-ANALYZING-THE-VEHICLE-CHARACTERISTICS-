# IMPACT-ON-FUEL-EFFICIENCY-BY-ANALYZING-THE-VEHICLE-CHARACTERISTICS-
Automobile data from 1970–1982 is analyzed to study how vehicle characteristics affect fuel efficiency. Using multiple regression, the project examines how horsepower, weight, acceleration, and design features relate to miles per gallon (MPG). The dataset includes 398 cars from the United States, Europe, and Japan.
